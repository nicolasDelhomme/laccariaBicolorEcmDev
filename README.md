The molecular timecourse of hybrid aspen/Laccaria bicolor ectomycorrhiza development

## Abstract

The project aims at deciphering the molecular timecourse of the establishment of Laccaria bicolor ectomycorrhiza on hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides, T89). Samples collected from various stage of the ectomycorrhiza have been collected and sequenced
